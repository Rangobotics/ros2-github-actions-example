# ROS2 Github Actions Example

A basic example on how to configure ROS2 CI with Github Actions using CI tools from the ROS Tooling WG. The action described in `.github/workflows/build.yaml` is ran using repos from `ros-tooling`.

It is aimed as a help by example as I found rather hard to configure a basic run using ros-tooling documentations without any tangible examples.
